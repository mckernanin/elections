Hi <?php echo esc_html( $unit_fname ); ?>,

Thanks for requesting an OA election for <?php echo esc_html( $unit_type ); ?> <?php echo esc_html( $unit_num ); ?>!
Your unit election is confirmed for <?php echo esc_html( $confirm_date ); ?>.
The OA chapter election team will arrive 15 minutes before your meeting begins at <?php echo esc_html( $meeting_time ); ?>.
A Scoutmaster or other unit leader will need to confirm the unit’s active attendance (50% required for the election) and eligible candidates on the ballot at that time.

Be sure to log into your request to add eligible Scouts to your election here: <a href="https://elections.tahosalodge.org/my-election/">My Election</a>. 
We’ll remind you about this 14 days, 7 days and 2 days prior to your election.
Really important -- your unit ballot is LOCKED 24 hours prior to your scheduled election and cannot change.

Election to the Order of the Arrow is an honor given by a Scout’s peers.
If the Unit Leader feels that an eligible Scout is not yet ready then uncheck the box marked “Scout Spirit.”
