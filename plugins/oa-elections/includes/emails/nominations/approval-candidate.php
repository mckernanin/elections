<?php echo $post_title; ?>, congratulations on your confirmation to the Order of the Arrow (OA), the National Honor Society of the Boy Scouts of America. Your nomination was confirmed by the council and the lodge as an adult leader who can help and encourage the ideals of Brotherhood, Cheerful, and Service in our Denver Scouts.<br>
We recognize Scouts who best exemplify the ideals of Scouting. The OA was founded in 1915 and has been an official program of the Boy Scouts of America since 1948. Since then tens of thousands of Scouts and Scouters have promoted camping, outdoor adventure, character and leadership, and helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to others.
Your confirmation into OA as an adult is just the first step of an amazing journey. To begin your membership in the Order of the Arrow you must complete your induction weekend called a Cony Party. During the Cony Party you will work next to your fellow OA candidates to improve our council camps. It is a time of reflection, contemplation of Scouting values, and service to others.
To complete your induction, you will need to participate in one of the 2017 Cony Parties. The lodge holds four such weekends per year to support your schedule.
<ul>
    <li>May 5 – 7 at Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch</li>
    <li>May 12 – 14 at Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch</li>
    <li>August 11 – 13 at Camp Tahosa</li>
    <li>September 29 – October 1 at Peaceful Valley Scout Ranch</li>
</ul><br>
An induction weekend must be completed within one year of selection. If you do not participate in one of these four weekend options, your unit will need to nominate you again for another year.
Please go to https://tahosalodge.org/cony-party/ for all the information you need about Cony Party events and to register to join in the adventure!
The Order of the Arrow is an amazing opportunity for our Scouts and has changed many of our members’ lives. Opportunities for personal growth in the OA include: improving leadership skills, and allowing networking with Scouts from not just Colorado, but around the country, which, often times, creates life long friends. Our lodge is building a 14.5 mile Arrowhead Trail around Peaceful Valley, leading a Cub Scout family camping weekend, and leading Colorado and the Western Region in cheerful service to Scouting. We are proud of our roster of youth leaders serving the area, region, and national program levels, and hope to have your adviser support to sustain this success.
If you have any questions or concerns about Cony Parties or the OA please reply to this email.
